<h1>Materials</h1>
<p>Be creative! Use what you have at home! The materials specified are purposefully vague, you won't find any Amazon links because if we all tried to use the same thing, we'd all just run out faster.</p>

<h2>Fabric</h2>
<p>Use anything. Old bedsheets, dish towels, napkins. No need to go out any buy anything new, that would miss the point.</p>

<h2>Filters</h2>
<p>More info forthcoming. For now check out <a href="https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-materials-make-diy-face-mask-virus/">https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-materials-make-diy-face-mask-virus/</a> for a good overview of existing data. We've been using air conditioning filters (1 or 2 layers of MERV-13 and MERV-14 filters, no fiberglass!). Anything is better than nothing, so even if you leave this out, the mask will help. (But don't let it give you a false sense of security).

<h2>Wire</h2>
<p>14 gauge copper wire works great, stiff but flexible enough to conform to the nose. (12 gauge will do in a pinch, but it's really stiff). Doubling up 18 gauge also works. If you don't have wire, be creative! You can also try:
    <ul>
    <li>Wire clothes hangers</li>
    <li>Garden wire</li>
    <li>Paper clips (you might need more than one to hold shape)</li>
    <li>Anything that bends but can hold a shape</li>
</ul>
    
    Tip: If using thin wire, fold back the ends so they don't end up poking through the fabric.
