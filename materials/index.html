<h1>Materials</h1>
<p>Be creative! Use what you have at home! The materials specified are purposefully vague, you won't find any Amazon links because if we all tried to use the same thing, we'd all just run out faster.</p>

<h2>Fabric</h2>
<p>Use anything. Old bedsheets, pillowcases, dish towels, napkins. <em>Literal rags</em>. No need to go out any buy anything new, that would miss the point. Flannel is super cozy. High thread count stuff actually has pretty decent filtration ability even without a "real" filter layer.</p>

<h2>Filters</h2>
<p>More info forthcoming. For now check out <a href="https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-materials-make-diy-face-mask-virus/">https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-materials-make-diy-face-mask-virus/</a> for a good overview of existing data. We've been using air conditioning filters (1 or 2 layers of MERV-13 and MERV-14 filters, no fiberglass!). Anything is better than nothing, so even if you leave this out, the mask will help. (But don't let it give you a false sense of security).

<h2>Wire</h2>
<p>14 gauge copper wire works great, stiff but flexible enough to conform to the nose. (12 gauge will do in a pinch, but it's really stiff). Doubling up 18 gauge also works. If you don't have wire, be creative! You can also try:
    <ul>
    <li>Wire clothes hangers</li>
    <li>Garden wire</li>
    <li>Paper clips (you might need more than one to hold shape)</li>
    <li>Anything that bends but can hold a shape</li>
</ul>
    
    Tip: If using thin wire, fold back the ends so they don't end up poking through the fabric.

<h1>Random Info That Might Be Handy</h1>

<p>Here's an unedited collection of random bits of info, updated very intermittently.</p>

   </li>
   
   <blockquote><em>
       <p>...Rigorous testing, known as particulate filtration, to evaluate 13 different designs from approximately 400 masks made by community volunteers...</p>

       <p>The best homemade masks achieved 79% filtration as compared to surgical masks (62% to 65%) and N95 masks (97%). But other homemade masks tested performed significantly worse, sometimes demonstrating as little as 1% filtration, Segal said.</p>

       <p>The best-performing design was constructed of two layers of high-quality, heavyweight “quilter’s cotton” with a thread count of 180 or more, and those with especially tight weave and thicker thread such as batiks. A double-layer mask with a simple cotton outer layer and an inner layer of flannel also performed well, he said.</p>
